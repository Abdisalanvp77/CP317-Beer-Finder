# CP317 Beer Finder Web App

## Inspiration
Have you ever had an idea of what kind of beer you wanted, maybe a lighter beer with hops and a low alcohol content, but you didnâ€™t know what brand would be best linked to your criteria?

Our web application hopes to solve this by asking for user search criteria and returning a list of beers that match their specifications in order from ***most alike*** to ***least alike***.

## Tools
### Front-end:
* **Scripting:** JavaScript
* **Structure:** HTML
* **Styling:** CSS / Bootstrap

### Back-end:
* **Server:** Django server routes in Python
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (built-in with Django) OR connection to a MySQL database
* **API:** Django GET and POST definitions for accessing/modifying database content
* **Data Structures:** List, Queue, Stack

### Connection between Front and Back-ends:
* Django has a templating system which allows for the inclusion and rendering of HTML files to our server
* All CSS and JS files are contained in a special folder named *static* where they can be referenced within the HTML file
* Django is responsible for hosting the web application, accessing and modifying our PostgreSQL database, and handling API GET and POST requests from the JS front-end client to access/modify data in the back-end
* JS is responsible for manipulating the HTML Document Object Model (DOM) and formulating front-end logic
* CSS and Bootstrap are used for styling

## Installation
